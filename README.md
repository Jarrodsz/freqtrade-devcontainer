# freqtrade-devcontainer

Freqtrade devcontainer for both local development and running container 
with docker-compose ( run in production )

### Goal
The goal of this repro would be to have 2 ways

1. A solid freqtrade development environment for local development with vscode for debugging and developming strats and run then inside the devcontaine for debugging.
2. A simple way to spinup several containers with a single strategy for production / vps long runs.
